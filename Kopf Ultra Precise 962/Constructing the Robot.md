## Assembly

* Remove the wheels from each arm of the instrument. This requires a torx bit.
  * First, unscrew the set screw on the measurement dial.
  * Beneath the dial, remove the second set screw, and pull the wheel off the arm.
* Prepare the 3D printed couplers by inserting the heat set inserts.
  * Drill holes on two adjacent sides of the coupler, at the guide holes on the side that attaches to the arm.
  * Using a soldering iron, gently press the inserts into the holes.
* Attach the 3D printed coupler to the stepper motors with the socket head screws.
* Place the 5mm shaft coupler on the arm's shaft, where the wheel attaches.
* Connect the 3D printed coupler and stepper motor to the instrument, and instert set scews.
* Tighten the shaft coupler, and reassemply the stereotaxic instrument.
