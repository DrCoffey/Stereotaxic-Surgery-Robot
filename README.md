# Stereotaxic Surgery Robot

This is an adaptation of the open-source robot stereotaxic instrument originally described by [Coffey et al., 2013.](https://www.jove.com/video/51006/building-an-open-source-robotic-stereotaxic-instrument)

By using stepper motors and 3D printed couplers, we can upgrade an existing stereotaxic instrument to a highly precise robot instrument for approximately $350.

This repository contains the coupler and [assembly instructions](Kopf%20Ultra%20Precise%20962/Constructing%20the%20Robot.md) to convert a Kopf Ultra Precise 962.

The robot is controlled by g-code sent to a CNC controller through Mach3.
